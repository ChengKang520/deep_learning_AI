4,https://www.healthcaremagic.com/questions/How-to-confirm-date-of-conception-during-pregnancy/560760,How to confirm date of conception during pregnancy?,My daughter had an ultra sound on May 3rd that said she was 9 weeks pregnant. I also found out ( to my heartbreak) that she had sex with one boy on/around March the 6th and another boy on March the 20th. Based on her ultra sound is there a greater chance on which one would most likely be the father? The 9 weeks pregnant/7 weeks gestation has me confused,"hi there, I will suggest you the best possible treatment options.As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycle, ovulation takes place around day 14 if the cycle.As per USG, she must have ovulated around 10th March. So the first unprotected sex activity,might be the most possible chance of her getting pregnant.I hope this answer helps you.Thanks.Dr. Purushottam Neurgankar"
