It affects the brain and the spinal chord. it's not necessary to affect your vision as such. if the optic nerve is weak already masturbation will worsen your eye's health.A healthy diet will restore your energy slowly but steadily. You can include nuts, fruits and vegetables. It's good to consume vitamin A containing food like papaya ripened mango that wil benefit your eyes. spinach and other leafy vegetables also help you improve your vision. It's advisable to reduce your mobile or laptop using time. Once you feel restored within few months you may gradually start your sexual activity. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.

Ejaculate is a mixture of sperm from testis that flows through the vas deference, prostate fluid and seminal fluid. Seminal fluids are propelled through the contractors muscles present in it which stores and releases semen, due to the years of masturbation your contractory muscles might have been weakens, since the seminal vesicle is placed close to the rectum, when you force to defecate yours seminal fluid is leaking. I suggest you to just allow your body to heal itself. Just stop masturbating, eat healthy diet including fruits,vegetables and proteins. It's better to indulge in aerobic exercises. These things will increase the antioxidant levels, blood supply to the required organs to heal and get restored by itself. And it's normal to have slight leakiness while indulging with your partner,it's just the pre-cum that lubricates the process of coitus. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.
