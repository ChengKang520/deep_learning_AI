I suggest you to quit masturbation completely and follow a healthy diet including fruits vegetables and nuts.This kind of diet have a high level of antioxidants that will reverse the negative effects of masturbation. It's better to indulge in aerobic exercises which in turn will increase your testosterone levels. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
