1,https://www.healthcaremagic.com/questions/Could-lack-of-hair-growth-be-due-to-masturbation/591085,Could lack of hair growth be due to masturbation?,"hai sir i am 25years old i used to do masturbation every day, even twice in a day and i don""t have much hair growth in my body face hands legs.... so please suggest me diet and medicine and tell me is there any relation between masturbation and hair growth","Hi, Since you said you masturbate frequently even twice a day, due to heavy masturbation the hormonal balance in the body is lost which leads to low testosterone levels in the body which is responsible for less hair on the face and body. I suggest you to quit masturbation completely and follow a healthy diet including fruits vegetables and nuts.This kind of diet have a high level of antioxidants that will reverse the negative effects of masturbation. It's better to indulge in aerobic exercises which in turn will increase your testosterone levels. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. "
